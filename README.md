Hotel Booking Analysis (EDA) 
Project Summary -
In the dynamic landscape of the hospitality industry, data-driven decision-making is essential for optimizing operations and enhancing customer experiences. This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a hotel booking dataset from Booking.com, capturing a wide range of information about bookings, customer profiles, and various booking channels. The dataset includes details such as booking lead times, arrival dates, meal plans, room types, and customer preferences.

The primary goal is to identify patterns and trends in booking behaviors, cancellations, and customer preferences to help Booking.com refine its operations. Given the competition in the hospitality sector, companies like Booking.com must continuously improve their booking processes and maximize revenue. By leveraging insights gained from this analysis, the company can streamline operations and tailor marketing efforts.

The project begins with a thorough examination of the dataset to clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing values and ensuring data consistency. This step is critical for ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses. Descriptive statistics are employed to explore customer demographics and booking patterns, revealing essential information about factors such as age, booking lead time, and hotel types preferred by different segments.

Key visualizations illustrate important findings, including booking percentages by hotel type, cancellation analysis, and insights into repeating guests. These visualizations help identify how various factors impact booking behavior, enabling targeted interventions to reduce cancellations. The project also investigates market segments that contribute most to bookings, highlighting trends that inform marketing strategies. Monthly booking distribution analysis identifies peak booking periods, assisting Booking.com in optimizing pricing and promotions.

Insights into the top countries by bookings and average lead time can help tailor offerings to meet diverse customer needs. Another critical aspect involves examining the average daily rate (ADR) across different hotel types and meal preferences. Understanding relationships between room types, meal plans, and pricing strategies can guide operational decisions, such as inventory management and dynamic pricing adjustments. The correlation heatmap helps identify relationships between various factors, offering insights into how different variables interact and influence operations.

The final deliverables include a comprehensive report detailing findings, supported by clear visualizations that illustrate key insights. Recommendations based on the analysis will focus on strategies for reducing cancellations, enhancing customer loyalty, and improving service delivery. The project aims to equip Booking.com with the necessary tools and insights to adapt to changing market conditions and anticipate guest needs.

In conclusion, this project contributes to understanding customer booking behaviors in the hospitality industry and provides Booking.com with a roadmap for making informed, data-driven decisions. By leveraging the insights gained from this analysis, the company can enhance its competitive advantage, drive profitability, and continue delivering exceptional service to its guests. â€‹
